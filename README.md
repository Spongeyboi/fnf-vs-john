# Friday Night Funkin - Vs John
A Friday Night Funkin mod made by Spongey, because I was bored. The animations are horrible ik ik. I don't own Adobe Animate.

# Credits
The mod uses scripts from other mods, so I'm crediting them like a good boy
> Kade Engine, because it's cool : https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine

> The game, obviously : https://github.com/NinjaMuffin99/Funkin

> Vs Torch, yoinked some of the code like a genius : https://github.com/TorchTheDragon/FNFTorchEdition : It was in a tutorial on gamebanana, I know absolutely nothing about this mod besides that

> Fun size whitty, because I felt like adding it in : [https://Uhhhh, what was that link again?](https://youtu.be/TGfKsEG0Mqk?t=5)

### Secrets
:flushed: Not telling, but I can say that some old songs that never made it into the mod are in the files, as well as HBFS

### Wanna contribute? Here's what's on the checklist
> Add easy/normal difficulty to If you Feel my love

> Finish Harder Better Faster Stronger (HBFS in files)

> Improve modchart








###### Mod by Spongey, using scripts made by KadeDev, and TorchTheDragon. Copyrighted songs belongs to the original composer, under fair use, otherwise I'm not cool.
